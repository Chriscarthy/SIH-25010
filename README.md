## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
In India, a vast majority of small and marginal farmers continue to depend on traditional knowledge, guesswork, or the advice of local vendors when making critical agricultural decisions. These include choosing the right crop, managing pests and diseases, and determining the appropriate amount and type of fertilizer. Unfortunately, this approach often results in poor crop yields, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to the overuse of chemical inputs.

Farmers in this category typically lack access to personalized, scientific advisory services that consider essential factors such as soil health, weather conditions, and crop history. Compounding the issue are barriers such as low levels of digital literacy, the absence of localized tools, and challenges in understanding resources due to language constraints. As a result, they are often unable to benefit from the advancements in modern agricultural technologies.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Solving this problem is crucial for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability in India. By providing small and marginal farmers with access to accurate, real-time, and personalized agricultural advice, it becomes possible to enhance crop yields, lower input costs, and improve overall livelihoods. Such an intervention can empower farmers to make informed decisions based on scientific data rather than relying on unreliable sources. It also plays a significant role in promoting sustainable farming practices, ensuring food security, and reducing the environmental impact of agriculture. Moreover, enabling such access in native languages and in formats that cater to low-literacy users will help bridge the digital divide in rural areas.

Expected Outcomes

The expected result of this project is the development of a smart advisory system that can be accessed through a mobile application or a chatbot interface. This solution should be capable of offering real-time, location-specific crop-related advice in multiple Indian languages. It must include features like soil health analysis, guidance on fertilizer application, weather-based alerts, and predictive analytics to help farmers plan their activities more efficiently. Additionally, the system should be able to detect pests and diseases through image uploads from mobile phones, provide real-time tracking of market prices for various crops, and support voice-based interaction for farmers with limited literacy. A feedback mechanism should also be incorporated to help continuously improve the system based on user experiences.
Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

As per the NABARD Report published in 2022, nearly 86% of Indian farmers fall under the small or marginal category. Various studies have shown that the use of ICT-based advisory tools in agriculture can result in a yield increase of 20 to 30 percent. With rising smartphone penetration even in rural areas, there is a significant opportunity to bring digital solutions to farmers’ fingertips, making it both timely and impactful to introduce a smart, scalable advisory system.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a mobile and voice-enabled smart advisory platform powered by artificial intelligence and real-time data analytics. This platform will integrate multiple data sources, including soil health cards, weather APIs, satellite imagery, historical crop data, and market price databases, to generate customized crop advisory for each user. The interface will support multiple Indian languages and voice interactions to ensure accessibility for farmers with low literacy levels. Farmers will be able to upload images of pest-affected crops to receive immediate identification and treatment suggestions using AI-powered image recognition technology.

Furthermore, the platform will provide regular updates about changing weather patterns, soil health insights, crop-specific recommendations, and local market prices. This approach ensures that farmers receive actionable insights tailored to their specific needs, location, and context. By centralizing all essential information into a single, easy-to-use platform, the solution addresses many of the systemic challenges that small and marginal farmers face in accessing modern agricultural knowledge.
## Technical Approach
The solution will be implemented using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. A mobile application will be developed using frameworks like React Native or Flutter to ensure compatibility across Android and iOS devices. The back-end system will be built using Node.js or Django and will include RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the app and external data sources. A database such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB will be used for storing user data, crop information, and analytics. Machine learning models developed using TensorFlow or PyTorch will handle pest detection, yield prediction, and other AI-driven features.

The system will integrate third-party APIs such as OpenWeather for weather forecasts, ISRO’s BHUVAN for satellite imagery, and Agmarknet for market prices. Voice support will be enabled through Google Dialogflow or Microsoft’s Azure Speech SDK. Data collected through user interactions and feedback will be used to refine the system over time. The development process will follow an agile methodology, allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback and testing.
## Feasibility and Viability
The proposed solution is highly feasible due to increasing digital infrastructure in rural India and growing smartphone penetration among farmers. Cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud will be used to ensure that the system is scalable and capable of handling large volumes of user data. Partnerships with local agricultural departments and NGOs can help promote adoption and provide on-ground support for farmers learning to use the system.

However, certain challenges must be addressed, including low digital literacy among some users and the variability of data quality in rural areas. These risks can be mitigated through the use of intuitive interfaces, local language support, and offline functionalities where possible. Training sessions and workshops conducted in collaboration with agricultural extension officers and local NGOs will also help ensure adoption and effective use.
## Impact and Benefits
The implementation of this solution has the potential to create significant positive impact across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Socially, it empowers farmers to make independent, informed decisions and reduces their dependence on unreliable third parties. Economically, it helps increase yield and income while reducing input costs, thereby improving financial stability for farming households. Environmentally, the solution promotes the responsible use of fertilizers and pesticides and encourages sustainable farming practices. In the long term, such a platform can contribute to national goals of food security and environmental conservation, while also supporting the digitization of rural India.

## Research and References
The proposed solution is based on several reliable data sources and research studies. The NABARD Report (2022) provides key insights into the demographics and challenges of small and marginal farmers in India. The Agmarknet portal offers real-time data on market prices, which is vital for the economic aspect of this advisory system. Weather forecasts and climate data will be sourced from OpenWeather APIs, while satellite imagery and crop monitoring insights can be obtained from ISRO’s BHUVAN portal. Additional reference material includes the World Bank’s e-sourcebook on ICT in Agriculture, which highlights the transformative impact of digital advisory services in the farming sector.
